This Project provides a comprehensive overview of the SPI design and its accompanying testbench, describing the functionality, structure, and usage of the SPI module and its verification components. The design is implemented using System Verilog for the SPI module and SystemVerilog for the testbench components.




Functionality
State Machine:
The SPI module operates using a state machine with the following states:
idle: Default state where no data transmission occurs.
enable: Prepares for data transmission.
send: Transmits data bits.
comp: Completes the data transmission process.
Clock Generation:

The sclk signal is generated by dividing the input clock clk by 20.
On every 10th positive edge of clk, sclk toggles.
Data Transmission:

When newd is asserted, the state machine moves from idle to send state, and the data in din is serialized bit by bit.
Data bits are sent LSB first through the mosi line.
After sending 12 bits, the state machine returns to the idle state.
