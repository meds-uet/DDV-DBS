This repository contains the SystemVerilog code for a parameterized counter along with its test bench. The counter can be configured to count up or down, with adjustable bit-width and maximum count value.

Parameterized Counter:

The parameterized counter module is highly configurable, allowing for various bit-widths and count modes. It can be used in various digital design applications requiring flexible counting mechanisms.

It cantains 2 files:

- The design file named "counter.sv".
- The test bench file name "tb.sv".
