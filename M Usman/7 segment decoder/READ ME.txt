This repository contains the SystemVerilog code for a 7-segment display decoder along with its test bench. The decoder translates a 4-bit binary input to the corresponding 7-segment display output.


7_segment_display_decoder:

The 7-segment display decoder takes a 4-bit binary input and produces a 7-bit output that controls the segments of a 7-segment display. Each segment can be turned on or off to represent hexadecimal digits (0-9, A-F).
