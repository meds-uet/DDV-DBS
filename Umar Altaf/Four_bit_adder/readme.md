4-Bit Adder
Overview
This repository contains a SystemVerilog implementation of a 4-bit adder. The module performs addition of two 4-bit binary numbers and produces a 4-bit sum along with a carry-out.

Features
Adds two 4-bit binary numbers.
Outputs a 4-bit sum and a carry-out.
Includes a testbench for verifying the functionality of the 4-bit adder.

This file contains the SystemVerilog code for the 4-bit adder module. The module takes two 4-bit inputs and a carry-in, then produces a 4-bit sum and a carry-out.

tb_four_bit_adder.sv
This file contains the SystemVerilog testbench for the 4-bit adder. The testbench verifies the functionality of the 4-bit adder by applying various test vectors and checking the output.
Usage
Prerequisites
To simulate the 4-bit adder module and its testbench, you need a SystemVerilog simulator such as ModelSim, VCS, or any other compatible tool.
